# Shouty

Shouty is a social networking application for short physical distances.
When someone shouts, only people within 100m can hear it.

Shouty doesn't exist yet - you will implement it yourself!

That is, if you're attending a BDD/SpecFlow course.

## You will need

* Visual Studio
* Install SpecFlow integration ([VS2015](http://www.specflow.org/documentation/Visual-Studio-2015-Integration/) or [VS2013](http://www.specflow.org/documentation/Visual-Studio-2013-Integration/))

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.net.git
    
_You can also use the [GitHub extentsion for Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.github.com/)._

Or simply [download](https://github.com/cucumber-ltd/shouty.net/releases) a zip and expand it into a directory on your computer.

## Import the project

* Open the `Shouty.NET.sln` file in visual studio
* Select Test > Run > All Tests from the menu, or press `CTRL-R, A`

if you see two tests failing, you're good to go.
